Oh wow, there are a HUGE number of moving parts in this demo:

* GatsbyJS is the React/GraphQL based static website generator he is using
* Vize.ai is the Machine Learning Image Recognition service he is using. He uploaded 5000 or so images in different orientations before the session started to create his dataset.
* AWS CodeCommit is his repo for the Gatsby based website
* Amazon S3 is where the files for the site live
* AWS Step Functions and Lambda is the purpose of this talk
* IAM is...well, it's IAM
* ECR is where his images are stored for CodeBuild
* Amazon Cloudfront is the CDN used
* Amazon DynamoDB is the source of the notes that appear on each page on the site
* Amazon API Gateway is the proxy for his camera to post images to s3
* AWS CodeBuild uses Docker to run a build script to build out the Gatsby website
* SNS is used by CodeCommit to notify Lambda to start wondering. And to notify Matt that the site is publish. I can hear his phone going off.
